        <p class="question"><a href="#">What happens if a card goes above 1Â¢? How does rotation work? When is the next rotation? How long are cards legal for?</a></p>
        <div class="details">
            <p>Legality is determined at the release of a Standard-legal set on Magic Online.</p>
            <p>Prices are checked every hour for a week. Anything 1c or less for half or more of all checks is legal for the season.</p>
            <p>Cards from the just-released set are added (nothing removed) a couple of weeks later via a supplemental rotation after prices have settled a little.</p>
            <p>Any version of a card on the legal cards list is legal.</p>
