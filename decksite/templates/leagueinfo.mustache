    <p><a href="{{signup_url}}">Sign Up Here</a></p>

    <p>Each league lasts roughly a month.  The <a href="{{records_url}}">current league</a> will run until {{end_date}}.</p>

    <p><b>You can <a href="{{signup_url}}">sign up</a> at any time.</b></p>

    <p>When you complete a five match league run for the first time ever you will get 1 tik credit with MTGO Traders (at the end of the month).</p>

    <p>A league run is five matches against five different decks/opponents.</p>

    <p>Your deck stays the same through a run but you can change decks for each run (or not if you want to play again with the same deck).</p>

    <p>You can only have one run going at once.</p>

    <p>If you don't want to finish a league run message <code>!retire</code> to PDBot on Magic Online or <a href="{{retire_url}}">retire</a> via the website and your run will end.</p>

    <p>Your deck will be checked for legality when you <a href="{{signup_url}}">sign up</a>.</p>

    <p>The easiest way to sign up is to export your deck from Magic Online and then upload it or copy it into the <a href="{{signup_url}}">sign up page</a>.</p>

    <p>To export your deck from Magic Online, right click on the name of the deck on the left of the Collection tab, then click export.</p>

    <p>PDBot will report your match result if it is watching your match but if not the winner should <a href="{{report_url}}">report the result</a> of the match.</p>

    <p>Make sure you have the right deck name for both you and your opponent's decks before submitting. Report any problems on <a class="external" href="https://discord.gg/H6EHdHu">Discord</a>.</p>
